### Benefit of Microsoft SSMS Storage.

# Methodology
### Tools Used
- Microsoft SSMS
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query
- DAX

  ### Development

  - Connected SQL database sources to Power BI
  - 
  - Performed ETL with Power Query (Using direct Query)
  - Cleaned  and joined tables using keys
  - Built star schema with proper cardinality
  - Created a Data table for time intelligence
  - Developed DAX KPI's (Revenue, Margin, Growth, etc.)


  ### ETL Process

  - Extract: Pulled data from SQL Server
  - Transformed: Renamed, cleaned, joined, added calculated fields (e.g ROI, nET Sales)
  - Load: Loaded into Power BI with schema integrity.
 

### Data Modelling 

- Star schema with FactSales at the center
- Dim tables joined via surrogate keys
- One-to-many relationships maintained
- Calendar table used for slicing and trends
  
### DAX Measures Created

- Total Sales = SUM(FactSales[SalesAmount])
- Gross Profit = SUM(FactSales[GrossProfit])
- Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Gross Profit], [Total Sales])
- Net Sales = [Total Sales] - SUM(FactSales[ReturnAmount])
- YoY Sales = [Total Sales CY] - [Total Sales PY]
- ROI = DIVIDE([Gross Profit], SUM(FactSales[DiscountAmount]))

### Analysis  

- Channel performance analysis (e.g., Online vs Reseller)
- Profit Margin trends by product subcategory and region
- YoY changes to evaluate performance trajectory
- Customer geography impact on sales volumes
- Seasonal patterns in Catalog profitability

### Visualization

- KPI Cards (Total Sales, YoY Change, Channel Sales)
- Donut & Bar Charts (Sales by Channel, Product)
- Geo Maps (Sales by Country & Region)
- Line Charts (Sales & Profit over Time)
- Tree Maps (Brand-wise Sales Split)
